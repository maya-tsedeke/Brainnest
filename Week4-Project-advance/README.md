This is a Python application that displays weather information for a specific location using the OpenWeatherMap API. It uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application.

## Requirements
To run this application, you will need:

1. Python 3.6 or later
2. Tkinter
3. requests
4. json
5. PIL
